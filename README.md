# ClangdConfigurationFile
A repository for my usual clangd configuration files, mainly `.clang-tidy` files.

We all know that `clangd` is a great tool for `C++`, and a big part of that is because it includes clang-tidy.
But clang-tidy is hard to configure, and requires writing a `json` or `yaml` configuration file. So I put the wirtten configuration file in this repository so that I can use it easily whenever I want.
